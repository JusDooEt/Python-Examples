# Python Examples
## About
This program is meant to be used as a reference sheet when creating future programs using python. This program includes and describes the correct syntax and formatting of declaring parameters, basic console input and output, arithmetic operators, logical operators and loops. This program also includes an example of a basic class declaration and examples of using class members and methods within the main program. There are further examples for class inheritance and method overwriting in the ‘Pet’, ‘Dog’ and ‘Cat’ classes.

## Why?
As a programmer I am most comfortable writing in C++ and I am currently trying to expand my knowledge of programming languages. I created this program to have a well documented example that I can easily come back to and use as a reference for syntax on other projects. Since C++ is my most proficient language I commented throughout the code making references to how python syntax is similar or different to C++. This will make it easier to remember and "translate" code from C++ to python or vice versa.

## Functionality
- Syntax for declaring and assigning variables.
- Examples of how arithmetic operators differ from C++
- Syntax for the use of logical operators 'and' and 'or'
- Example of if and else if statements
- Example of a while loop and string formatting
- Example and syntax of list objects
  - Examples of how to manipulate lists
  - Examples of using common list methods (insert, append, len)
- Example of for loops
- Example and syntax of range objects
  - Example of use case of a range object in for loops
- Example and syntax of tuples
  - Treated like a constant array
- Example of a class object 'Person'
  - The 'Person' class is defined in the [classes.py](classes.py) file
  - This class include four members to store a person's information
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Age
    - A boolean variable representing whether or not a person likes pizza or not
  - This class also has to example methods also defined in [classes.py](classes.py)
    - One method called 'walk' will display the text 'walking...'
    - The other method called 'run' will display the text 'running...'
- Example of a base class and class inheritance with the 'Pet' class
  - Two subclasses inherit from the base class 'Pet'
    - The classes 'Dog' and 'Cat' inherits the members of the pet class and overwrites the show and speak methods
    - The 'Cat' class also adds a new member to its subclass and has an example of how to properly initialize the base class members.
